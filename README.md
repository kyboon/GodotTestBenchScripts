# GodotTestBenchScripts

This is the test scripts I used in Godot Test Bench (https://kyboon.itch.io/godot-test-bench)

The A* pathfinding script is a modified version of Sebastian Lague's work. (https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding/tree/master, Episode 02 - grid)

I tried to clean up the code but there will be places where I use CamelCase in GDScript or snake_case in C#. That's just difficult to avoid when working in two languages that uses different naming conventions.
